    Coal is a valuable hard, black material extracted from mines. Wood that has been buried for a long time becomes coal due to a chemical change. Earthquakes cause vast forest areas to sink underground and contribute to such changes as a result of tremendous heat and pressure. Coal mines can be found in our country at  Dhanbad, Jharia, Giridih, Chaibasa, and other locations. Coal is exported from India to Japan, Nepal, and Bangladesh. Coal is used as a fuel in both homes and factories and industries. The majority of trains and steamers move by burning coal in steam engines.

<p> I have a tiny garden area on my patio. Is it enough room to plant the three sisters corn, beans, and squash  in the spring? Will there be enough corn for it to pollinate? Will there be enough room for the squash to spread? And most important of all, will I feel more connected to the earth and the gift of food if my garden grows well</p>

<P>The poet sees different sceneries while travelling by train. He sees bridges, houses, ditches and hedges. Meadows, where horses and cattle are gazing, hills, plains and painted buildings of railway stations can be seen. The poet also sees a child climbing up a steep ground collecting blackberries, a homeless man standing and watching as the train passes by, village women making garland out of daisies, a cart moving laboriously on the highway with the weight of the load and a man on it. He also sees a mill and rivers. They all pass by very quickly, disappearing as fast as they appeared.</P>
